This project implements a simple guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret number chosen at random within a specified range. The game prompts the player to enter a minimum and maximum number to set the range, and then allows them a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. The player receives feedback after each guess, indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
